DATA TRANSFORMATIONS
    - MAP
        • Map is similar to for each method but map creates a new array based on the original array
        • Contains a callback function that performs some operation on the original array
    - FILTER
        • Used to filter for elements in the original array which satisfies given condition
        • Will create new array with filtered elements
    - REDUCE
        • Boils down all the elements of the original array into a single value
        • No new array in this case but only the reduced value
