First Class Functions
    • JS treats functions as first class citizens
    • This means that functions are simply values
        ◦ store function in varaible or properties
        ◦ pass function as argument to other functions
        ◦ return a function from another functions
    • Functions are just another type of object
    • It is a feature that a programming might have or might not have

Higher Order Functions
    • A function that receives another function as an argument, that returns a new function or both
    • This is only possible because of First Class Functions
