Sources
    • From the Program itself
        ◦ Data written directly into source code. Example: status message
    • User Interface
        ◦ Data input from the user or data written in DOM. Example: tasks in to-do app
    • External Sources
        ◦ Data fetched from API's


• Usually we get collection of data from the above Sources
• We use Data Structures to store all such data
• There are 4 built-in data Structures in JS
    ◦ Data as list?
        → Array
        → Set
    ◦ Key-Value Pair?
        → Objects
        → Maps

ARRAYS vs SET
• We can use both for simple list of values

    • ARRAYS
        ◦ When we need ordered list of values.
        ◦ Might contain duplicate
        ◦ Used when we need to manipulate data
    • SET
        ◦ When we need to work with unique values
        ◦ Used when high-performance is really important
        ◦ Used to remove duplicates from array


OBJECTS vs MAPS
• We can use both for key-value data structure

    • OBJECTS
        ◦ More traditional key/value structure
        ◦ keys can only be string
        ◦ Easy to write and access values with . and []
        ◦ When we need to include funtions(method) with this keyword
        ◦ Working with JSON data
    • MAPS
        ◦ Better performance
        ◦ Keys can have any data type
        ◦ Easy to iterate
        ◦ Easy to compute size
