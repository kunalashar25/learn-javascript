Event Loop
    • Event loop makes async behaviour possible in javascript
    • loading images in js is async, it does not happen in the call stack
    • it happends in webAPI environment
    • Event loop coordinates between call stack and callback queue
    • event loop decides when each callback will be executed.

MICROTASKS
    • callbacks of promise have a special queue
    • It is called Microtasks queue
    • Microtasks queue has priority over callback queue
    • all events from microtasks queue would be exeucted before running any event from the callback queue
    • We call callbacks from promise as microtasks. Hence, microtasks queue
    • if one microtasks adds another microtask then all microtasks will be executed before exeuting any event from the callback queue
