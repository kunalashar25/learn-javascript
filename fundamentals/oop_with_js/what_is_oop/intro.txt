WHAT IS OOP?
    • OOP is a programming paradigm that is based on the concepts of objects.
        ◦ Paradigm means Style of the code - how we write and organize code
    • Obeject contains data (properties) and code (methods). We pack them together into one block.
    • Objects are self-contained pieces of code

CLASSES AND INSTANCES
    • Class acts as a blueprint which can be used to create new objects based on the rules described in the class
    • All objects created from a class are called Instances

4 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES
    • ABSTRACTION
        ◦ Hide details that does not matter
        ◦ Gives us an overview of things we are implementing
    • ENCAPSUALTION
        ◦ Keep properties and methods private inside the class.
        ◦ Some methods can be exposed as a public interface (API).
    • INHERITANCE
        ◦ For Code Reusability
        ◦ Parent - Child relationship
    • POLYMORPHISM
        ◦ Many Forms
