// Note:
// 1. Classes are not Hoisted. Function Declarations are Hoisted.
// Which means we can use them before they are declared in the code but with classes, that does not work.
// 2. Classes are first class citizens, means we can pass them into functions and return them from functions.
// 3. Classes is always executed in strict mode
