How is Javascript code Executed?
    • Code Execution Begins after Compilation Strategies
    • Global Execution Context is created for the top level code
        ◦ Top level code is a code which is not inside any function
        ◦ Function body is only executed when it is called
        ◦ Execution Context is an abstract context
            → It is an environment in which a piece of Javascript is executed
            → It stored all the necessary information for some code to be executed
            → Exactly one global execution context (EC) 
    • Execution of top level code (inside global EC)
    • Execution of functions and waiting for callbacks
        ◦ For each and every function call, a new execution context will be created.
        ◦ It will contain all the information that is necessary to run that function.
        ◦ All execution context makes up the Call Stack

What is inside EXECUTION CONTEXT?
    • Variable environment
        ◦ All variables and function declarations are stored
            → let, const, and var declarations
            → Functions
            → argument object - all arguments passed to the functions
    • Scope Chain
        ◦ Contains references to variables that are located outside of the current function.
        ◦ To keep track of Scope Chain, it is stored in each Execution Context
    • this keyword
        ◦ Not applicable for arrow functions
            → arrow functions will not have arguments object as well

CALL STACK
    • Call Stack with Memory Heap makes up the Javascript Engine
    • Call Stack is a place where Execution Context gets stacked on top of each other in order to keep track of the program execution.
    • Follows LIFO structure
