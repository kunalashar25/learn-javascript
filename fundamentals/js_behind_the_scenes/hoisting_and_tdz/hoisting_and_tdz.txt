HOISTING
    • Makes some types of variables accessible/usable in the code before they are actually declared.
    • Variables are lifted to the top of their scope. Behind the scene:
        → Before Execution, code is scanned for varaible declarations, 
        → And for each varaible, a new property is created in the variable environment object.
