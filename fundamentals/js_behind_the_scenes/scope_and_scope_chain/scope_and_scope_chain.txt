What is SCOPING?
    • Where program varaibles are organized and accessed?
        ◦ Where do variables live?
        ◦ Where can we access a certain varaible and where not?
    
 What is LEXICAL SCOPING?
    • Scoping is controlled by placement of functions and blocks in the code          

What is SCOPE?
    • Space or Environment in which a certain varaible is declared.
    • Types of Scope:
        ◦ Global
            → Top-level code
            → Outside of any function or block
            → Varaible declared inside global scope can be accessed any where
        ◦ Function
            → Varaibles are accessible only inside functions and not outside
            → Also called Local Scope
            → var varaibles will be linked to function scope even when it is written inside the block.
        ◦ Block (ES6)
            → Everything within curly braces
            → varaible are accessible only inside block
            → only applies to let and const varaibles
            → functions are also blocked scoped (only in strict mode)

What is SCOPE OF VARIABLE?
    • Region of our code where a certain varaible can be accessed.
