Working of THIS keyword
    • Special varaible that is created for every execution context
    • Takes the value of the "owner" of the funtion in which the this keyword is used
    • this is NOT static. It depends on how the function is called.
    • Its value is only assigned when the function is actually called
    • Ways to call this keyword:
        ◦ Method
            → function attached to an object
            → this = <object that is calling the method>        
        ◦ Simple Function call
            → this = undefined (only when using strict mode. Otherwise window)
        ◦ Arrow Functions
            → Arrow functions do not get their own this keyword
            → this = <this of surrounding function(lexical this)>
        ◦ Event Listener
            → this = <DOM element that the handler is attached to>
