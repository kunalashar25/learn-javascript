# Javascript: Zero to Expert!

This repo will cover all the concepts required to learn javascript from scratch.

I have created this repo as a part of self-learning and development referring the Udemy Course - [The Complete Javascript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course)

## Project Structure

- `fundamentals` → Minute details with examples on each and every topic in javascript
- `assignments` → Practice assignments on each topic to improve our coding skills
- `challenges` → Scenario driven challenge to cover multiple topics to get the output
- `concept_images` → Structure images for reference
- `course-materials` → Material shared during the entire course

## How to Begin with JS?

If you're new to Javascript world then start learning the fundamentals first as this will act as the building block for the overall language understanding.

- Pick a topic from `fundamentals`, Understand the topic and practice a sample problem.
- Move to `Assignment` to solve an assignment on the same topic.
- Repeat this steps for all the sections/topics present inside fundamentals.
- At the end of each section, Move to `challenges` and try to complete all 4 challanges for the section.
